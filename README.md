This script also uses playsound to play a file called alarm.mp3 located in the same directory. This can be changed, as
long as it has the same filename.

## Install Requirements
```python
pip install pytchat
pip install playsound
```

## Run script
```python
pip install pytchat
pip install playsound
```

## Complied version
You can also use cult_chat.exe to run a pre-compiled version if you do not have Python installed.
